		<description>The "meat" of a Beet is a strange substance coated in substances similar to cellulose and fiber, making it closer to vegetable than flesh. Herbivorous animals can and will eat it, as it can be digested by them, and likewise, carnivores are incapable of digesting it alone. Beet meat is more nutritious than many foods and takes a very, very long time to rot. It is remarkaly delicious. \n \n Due to the fact that Beets are sapient beings, eating their flesh is abhorrent for some, but "fascinating" for those already willing to eat their own kind.</description>
