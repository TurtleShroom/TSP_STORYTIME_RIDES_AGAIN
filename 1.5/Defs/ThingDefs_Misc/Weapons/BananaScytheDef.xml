	The original text to this weapon was: "An accurate recreation of one of the legendary Ancient Weapons crafted by Colin after his victory over Allah in the Jeub-Muslim War.". I have removed this because it breaks immersion and I don't like RL religions in this game.
	
	It is pleasing to know that Isengriff hates Islam as much as me.

		<description>The Banana Scythe is a strange weapon, originally crafted by Snaff Colin, who is worshipped by Jeubs as the Lord of Eternal Alchemy. This is a rare example of a replica successfully embued with its power. As its name implies, it is shaped like a golden scythe with a head in the shape of a banana. Uniquely, however, any person cursed by its magic, or killed by its blade, will have their body converted atom by atom into a special banana, killing them instantly. Those who would stand against its wielder would do well to be cautious, for death is perhaps not the worst fate one may suffer...</description>
