    My first Mod, literally adds some creatures I tried making to try and get better at modding.
	They're not broken or anything its just that you (player man/woman) might find the quality quite lacking lol.
	Anyways I plan to put in as much detail work as I can. The mod currently includes:
	
		- Meffalo
		- Boomsloth
	
	Please keep in mind I'm still working on this mod so... yeah.
	If you have any suggestions or see any bugs feel free to comment.
