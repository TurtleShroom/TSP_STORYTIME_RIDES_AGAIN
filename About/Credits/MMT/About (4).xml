		～Created by google translation～

		Contents
		A metal max-like car + drum can is added as an animal.

		Wild buses, mosquitoes, buggies, wolfs, armored vehicles and drums will appear in each biome.
		From the added car (pet), you can harvest Namari mushrooms and components (Wolf is an advanced component) on a regular basis.
		Also, if you dismantle the car corpse, you will get a lump of iron scraps and components (same as above).


		◎2021/07/16 Update
		-Supports Ver1.3. It should be okay because the load folder is divided so that it works with Ver1.2 / 1.1.

		◎2021/01/25 Update
		-Angelring can now be created. Prosthetics research is needed.

		◎2021/01/15 Update
		-Namari mushrooms are now in the material category, no more manual transportation instructions
		-You can now process Namaritake mushrooms on a fuel-powered workbench.

		◎2021/01/08 Update
		-The remaining durability is now displayed while the car is wearing the tile pack.
		Thank you Udon!
		-Changed the items that can be obtained by cutting the hair of the car from iron scraps to namari mushrooms.
		Namari mushrooms can be refined into iron in the blast furnace in the raw material category, just like iron scraps.

		◎ 2021/01/03 Update
		-If the hunger rate is 0%, it may freeze when the caravan is configured, so set the hunger rate only slightly.

		◎ 2020/08/07 Update
		-I tried to see if it works with Ver1.2, so it was ok so I wrote the support version.

		◎2020/06/13 Update
		-We have implemented a vehicle tile pack that can be produced and used by introducing the Animal Gear MOD.
		It is treated like a shield belt that breaks with certain damage.
		Production requires plate armor research.

		◎2020/06/09 Update
		-An angel ring has been added as a type of implant. In addition, it is a complete minus item.
		-The frequency of iron scraps collected from each car has been changed from 5th to 15th.

		◎ 2020/05/19 Update
		-Slightly modified Patch because the illustration of drum mod was replaced.

		◎ 2020/05/18 Update
		-Since the drumcan was unexpectedly strong, some abilities such as armor value were corrected.
		-If you have introduced MMDrumcan MOD, we have included a patch that will allow cars to bathe.
		　MMMDrumcan MOD → https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2100895553

		◎2020/05/10 Update
		- Added melee attack method to drums.
		- If you introduce "Range Animal Framework (Continued)" (+ Harmony) as a prerequisite mod, some vehicles will be able to carry out long range attacks.

		I would like to take this opportunity to thank you.
