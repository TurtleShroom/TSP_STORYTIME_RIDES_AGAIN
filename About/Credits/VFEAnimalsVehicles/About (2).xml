	<description>Vehicles are something that is definitely missing in RimWorld. You have horses that you can ride on thanks to Giddy Up, you have spaceships that you can fly about with thanks to SRTS. You have single use drop pods in vanilla game, and yet, simple cars were nowhere to be found.

Here, at Vanilla Expanded, we treat such treason seriously. Vanilla Vehicles Expanded is a mod adding not one, not two, but five unique vehicles. They appear naturally in the world, they use chemfuel to power them through life, and most importantly, they are there for you, available anytime!
