		<description>"Mmm, this looks tasty. Wait, it was once a WHAT?!" \n \n This man-sized, magical banana is the terminal stage of the Banana Scythe's curse. It was once a living Pawn, but when he came into contact with the Banana Scythe and died while the curse was in effect, he was transformed, atom by atom, into a banana. The process killed him, and the result isn't even especially delicious, tasting "off" when eaten raw. If it is cooked into a meal, however, most people are not capable of tasting anything except a banana that was not allowed to ripen.</description>
