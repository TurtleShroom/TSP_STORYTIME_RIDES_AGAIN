    <description>"In this game, it's made of milk and sugar, not butter. Close enough, right? At any rate, it's pretty tasty." \n \n Butterscotch is a brittle confectionary derived from butter and brown sugar. It was developed on Old Earth in the nineteenth cenutry, and has remained popular ever since. A recipe invented by the Gnomes allowed for the candy to be made without butter and with any sugar. This recipe has supplanted the original recipe in most of the galaxy.</description>
