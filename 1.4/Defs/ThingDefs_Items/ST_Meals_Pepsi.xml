		<description>Pepsi-Cola is a carbonated soft drink made using an ancient formula that is inferior in every respect to the equally ancient formula of Coca-Cola. Invented on Old Earth in 1893 AD, the drink is the biggest competitor to Coca-Cola and bares one of the most recognizable, beautiful logos in the galaxy. It tastes like a sweeter, thicker version of flat Coca-Cola and is not as fizzy. \n \n This particular Pepsi-Cola product is generated by the body of a Pepsi Frog. It tastes, in every conceivable way, exactly like Pepsi-Cola, and is even naturally carbonated!</description>
