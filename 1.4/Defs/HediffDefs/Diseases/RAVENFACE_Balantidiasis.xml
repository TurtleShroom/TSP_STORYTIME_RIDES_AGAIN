		<description>Balantidiasis is a slow-acting, parasitic infection caused by the &lt;i>Balantidium coli&lt;/i> protist. Despite their taxonomic name and appearance under the microscope, they are not a bacterium (which is instead classified as the Monera Kingdom). Protists are not bacteria because they have eucaryotic cells, meaning that their sole cell has a nucleus. Symptoms most commonly include sharp pain and vomiting. It is not lethal to its host.</description>
