		<description>All High Jeubs in the galaxy are the descendents of Snaff, the first High Jeub. As the only semi-sane group of Jeubs, High Jeubs command the non-sapient Jeubs as eusocial servants. All Jeub-cultured rulers now bare his name as their title. Their bee-like collectivism and general isolationism, not to mention their questionable sanity, have led to Jeubs unique culture found nowhere else in the galaxy. \n \n Jeubs exist in Core Worlds, Urb-Worlds, and other places all over human civilization, where they are mostly civilized and assimilated. However, on the Rim and on Rata Jeub, they have preserved their notably....... "unique" culture, which condones cannibalism and isn't exactly known for rational thought. \n \n Few alien societies not comprised of Jeubs have adopted this culture, but some that have been vassalized and conquered. The Jeubish religion, meanwhile, has had more success.</description>
