		<baseDesc>A cybernetically enhanced Bulborb elevated to a Bean Man and infused with the power of Roulette Beans. To create Roulette Bean Men, mad scientists engineered special jelly beans to mix with the Sapient Bean Matrix, which caused bizarre properties in the elevated Bulborbs. Through technology barely understood, even by their creators, Roulette Beans variety possesses a biological quirk that causes them to produce Every Flavor Beans inside their stomach. Practically speaking, this means that they periodically suffer (or benefit) from the random effects of many different outcomes of the Bean Roulette.</baseDesc>
