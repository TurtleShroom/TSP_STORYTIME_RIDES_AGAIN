# TSP_STORYTIME_RIDES_AGAIN

Thank you for downloading the revived version of Isengriff's Storytime Mod. I am both humbled and honored to have continued Isengriff's legacy and bring one of the greatest 'Rimworld' Mods ever made back to the general public.

I could not have done any of this without the support of many talented men. 

This includes, but is not limited to the contributions of the following participants: 

* BRATWURSTINATOR
* EVELYN
* GARBAGE DAY IS HERE TO STAY
* STEVEO.O

To all others who gave me advice, thank you. 

Warmest regards,
-TURTLESHROOM
