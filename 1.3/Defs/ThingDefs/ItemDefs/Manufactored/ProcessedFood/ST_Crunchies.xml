    <description>When something is "crunchy", it refers to foodstuff that makes a muffled grinding (crunching) sound when chewed or pressed. A crunchy food will provide sustained, granular resistence to being chewed. "Crunchies" refer to a baked good, cracker, or other such pastry that is mass produced, consumed in handfuls, and intended to be crunched. They are often sweet. \n \n These crunchies, a Gnome delicacy, are derived from the meat of worms mixed with sugar, baked until hard and dry, and ground up into little snacks. They smell amazing and taste delicious. Consuming Worm Crunchies will provide a boost to a Pawn's Recreation.</description>
